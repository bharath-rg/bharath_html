            <p>Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser</p>
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
                Photograph of Tim Berners-Lee in April 2009 Tim Berners-Lee in April 2009 In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor
                at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989,
                Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and
                wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer
                Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by
                CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"
                and put an encyclopedia first.
            </p>    
            Markup HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based
            data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like
            </p>
                 although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example
            <img>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening
            tags and closing tags).
            <p>
                <h1> Elements </h1>
                Main article: HTML element HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document
                by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus:
               .[71][better source needed] In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair
                of tags: a "start tag"
                and "end tag". The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags. Tags may also
                enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates
                further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element. The start tag may also include attributes
                within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document,
                identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the document, and for some tags such
                as the
                <img> used to embed images, the reference to the image resource.</p>
            </p>
                    Semantic HTML Main article: Semantic HTML Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded
                    information over its presentation (look). HTML has included semantic markup from its inception,[82] but
                    has also included presentational markup, such as
                    <font>,
                        <i> and
                            <center> tags. There are also the semantically neutral span and div tags. Since the late 1990s, when Cascading
                                Style Sheets were beginning to work in most browsers, web authors have been encouraged to
                                avoid the use of presentational HTML markup with a view to the separation of presentation
                                and content.[83] In a 2001 discussion of the Semantic Web, Tim Berners-Lee and others gave
                                examples of ways in which intelligent software "agents" may one day automatically crawl the
                                web and find, filter and correlate previously unrelated, published facts for the benefit
                                of human users.[84] Such agents are not commonplace even now, but some of the ideas of Web
                                2.0, mashups and price comparison websites may be coming close. The main difference between
                                these web application hybrids and Berners-Lee's semantic agents lies in the fact that the
                                current aggregation and hybridization of information is usually designed in by web developers,
                                who already know the web locations and the API semantics of the specific data they wish to
                                mash, compare and combine. An important type of web agent that does crawl and read web pages
                                automatically, without prior knowledge of what it might find, is the web crawler or search-engine
                                spider. These software agents are dependent on the semantic clarity of web pages they find
                                as they use various techniques and algorithms to read and index millions of web pages a day
                                and provide web users with search facilities without which the World Wide Web's usefulness
                                would be greatly reduced.

                    HTML Application Main article: HTML Application An HTML Application (HTA; file extension ".hta") is a Microsoft Windows application
                    that uses HTML and Dynamic HTML in a browser to provide the application's graphical interface. A regular
                    HTML file is confined to the security model of the web browser's security, communicating only to web
                    servers and manipulating only web page objects and site cookies. An HTA runs as a fully trusted application
                    and therefore has more privileges, like creation/editing/removal of files and Windows Registry entries.
                    Because they operate outside the browser's security model, HTAs cannot be executed via HTTP, but must
                    be downloaded (just like an EXE file) and executed from local file system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Attributes Main article: HTML attribute Most of the attributes of an element are name-value pairs, separated by = and written
                    within the start tag of an element after the element's name. The value may be enclosed in single or double
                    quotes, although values consisting of certain characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not XHTML).[73][74]
                    Leaving attribute values unquoted is considered unsafe.[75] In contrast with name-value pair attributes,
                    there are some attributes that affect the element simply by their presence in the start tag of the element,[6]
                    like the ismap attribute for the img element.[76] There are several common attributes that may appear
                    in many elements : The id attribute provides a document-wide unique identifier for an element. This is
                    used to identify the element so that stylesheets can alter its presentational properties, and scripts
                    may alter, animate or delete its contents or presentation. Appended to the URL of the page, it provides
                    a globally unique identifier for the element, typically a sub-section of the page. For example, the ID
                    "Attributes" in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Attributes. The class attribute provides a way of
                    classifying similar elements. This can be used for semantic or presentation purposes. For example, an
                    HTML document might semantically use the designation
                    <class="notation"> to indicate that all elements with this class value are subordinate to the main text of the document.
                        In presentation, such elements might be gathered together and presented as footnotes on a page instead
                        of appearing in the place where they occur in the HTML source. Class attributes are used semantically
                        in microformats. Multiple class values may be specified; for example
                        <class="notation important">
                            puts the element into both the notation and the important classes. An author may use the style attribute to assign presentational
                            properties to a particular element. It is considered better practice to use an element's id or
                            class attributes to select the element from within a stylesheet, though sometimes this can be
                            too cumbersome for a simple, specific, or ad hoc styling. The title attribute is used to attach
                            subtextual explanation to an element. In most browsers this attribute is displayed as a tooltip.
                            The lang attribute identifies the natural language of the element's contents, which may be different
                            from that of the rest of the document. For example, in an English-language document:

        Early life and education
    </h2>
    <p>
        Jack Ma was born Ma Yun on 10 September 1964 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. When Ma was twelve, he bought a pocket radio.
        He started to listen to English radio everyday and gradually loved English. He began studying English at a young
        age by conversing with English-speakers at Hangzhou International Hotel. For nine years, Ma would ride 17 miles on
        his bicycle to give tourists tours of the area to practice his English. He became pen pals with one of those foreigners,
        who nicknamed him "Jack" because he found it hard to pronounce his Chinese name. Later in his youth, Ma struggled
        attending college. The Chinese entrance exams are held only once a year and Ma took four years to pass. The main
        reason was Ma was bad at mathematics. Ma attended Hangzhou Teacher's Institute (currently known as Hangzhou Normal
        University) and graduated in 1988 with a Bachelor of Arts in English. While at school, Ma was head of the student
        council. After graduation, he became a lecturer in English and international trade at Hangzhou Dianzi University.
        He also applied ten times to Harvard Business School and got rejected each time.Ma applied for 30 different jobs
        and got rejected by all. "I went for a job with the police; they said, 'you're no good'", Ma told interviewer Charlie
        Rose. "I even went to KFC when it came to my city. Twenty-four people went for the job. Twenty-three were accepted.
        I was the only guy ...". In 1994, Ma heard about the Internet and also started his first company, Hangzhou Haibo
        Translation Agency. In early 1995, he went to the US with his friends, who helped introduce him to the Internet.
        Although he found information related to beer from many countries, he was surprised to find none from China. He also
        tried to search for general information about China and again was surprised to find none. So he and his friend created
        an "ugly" website related to China. He launched the website at 9:40 AM, and by 12:30 PM he had received emails from
        some Chinese investors wishing to know about him. This was when Ma realized that the Internet had something great
        to offer. In April 1995, Ma and He Yibing (a computer teacher) opened the first office for China Pages and Ma started
        their second company. On May 10, 1995, they registered the domain chinapages.com in the United States. Within three
        years, the company had made 5,000,000 Chinese Yuan which at the time was equivalent to US$800,000. Ma began building
        websites for Chinese companies with the help of friends in the US. He said that "The day we got connected to the
        Web, I invited friends and TV people over to my house", and on a very slow dial-up connection, "we waited three and
        a half hours and got half a page", he recalled. "We drank, watched TV and played cards, waiting. But I was so proud.
        I proved the Internet existed". At a conference in 2010, Ma revealed that he has never actually written a line of
        code nor made one sale to a customer. He acquired a computer for the first time at the age of 33. From 1998 to 1999,
        Ma headed an information technology company established by the China International Electronic Commerce Center, a
        department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. In 1999, he quit and returned to Hangzhou with
        his team to found Alibaba, a China-based business-to-business marketplace site in his apartment with a group of 18
        friends. He started a new round of venture development with 500,000 yuan. Jack Ma at 2007 China Trust Global Leaders
        Forum In October 1999 and January 2000, Alibaba twice won a total of a $25 million foreign venture capital investment.
        The program was expected to improve the domestic e-commerce market and perfect an e-commerce platform for Chinese
        enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to address World Trade Organization (WTO) challenges.
        Ma wanted to improve the global e-commerce system and from 2003 he founded Taobao Marketplace, Alipay, Ali Mama and
        Lynx. After the rapid rise of Taobao, eBay offered to purchase the company. However, Ma rejected their offer, instead
        gathering support from Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang with a $1 billion investment. In September 2014 it was reported
        Alibaba was raising over $25 billion in an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange.[26] Alibaba
        became one of the most valuable technology companies in the world after raising the full $25 billion, the largest
        initial public offering in US financial history. Ma served as executive chairman of Alibaba Group, which is a holding
        company with nine major subsidiaries: Alibaba.com, Taobao Marketplace, Tmall, eTao, Alibaba Cloud Computing, Juhuasuan,
        1688.com, AliExpress.com, and Alipay. In November 2012, Alibaba's online transaction volume exceeded one trillion
        yuan. As of 2016, Ma is the owner of Château de Sours in Bordeaux, Chateau Guerry in Côtes de Bourg and Château Perenne
        in Blaye, Côtes de Bordeaux. On 9 January 2017, Ma met with United States President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower,
        to discuss the potential of 1 million job openings in the following five years through Alibaba's interest in the
        country. On 8 September 2017, to celebrate Alibaba's 18th year of establishment, Ma appeared on stage and gave a
        Michael-Jackson-inspired performance. He performed part of "Can You Feel The Love Tonight" at the 2009 Alibaba birthday
        event while dressed as a heavy metal lead singer. In the same month, Ma also partnered with Sir Li Ka-shing in a
        joint venture to offer a digital wallet service in Hong Kong. Ma announced on 10 September 2018 that he would step
        down as executive chairman of Alibaba Group Holding in the coming year. Ma denied reports that he was forced to step
        aside by the Chinese government. and stated that he wants to focus on philanthropy through his foundation. Daniel
        Zhang would then lead the way ahead for Alibaba as the current executive chairman.
